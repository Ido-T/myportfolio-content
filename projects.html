    <p>
As a Cloud Administrator, I specialize in designing, deploying, and maintaining secure, scalable, 
	  and high-performance cloud infrastructures within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. 
	  My name is Jeff Iberdo Thomas, and I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, 
	  equipped with a solid understanding of cloud architecture principles, cost optimization strategies, 
	  and industry-leading best practices for security and governance.
	  My core expertise includes configuring and managing AWS services such as EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, RDS, and CloudWatch, 
	  as well as implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions using AWS CloudFormation and Terraform to automate provisioning and ensure consistency across environments.

I focus on building fault-tolerant systems with high availability and elasticity, 
applying AWS services like Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and CloudFront to enhance performance and user experience. 
I also have experience managing identity and access management policies to enforce the principle of least privilege and maintain compliance with security frameworks.
 Monitoring, logging, and incident response are key areas of my workflow, where I utilize CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and other observability tools 
 to maintain visibility into system health and proactively address potential issues.

My approach to cloud administration combines hands-on technical execution with a deep understanding of cloud economics, 
enabling organizations to balance cost efficiency with operational excellence. 
I am passionate about continuous learning and keep pace with emerging AWS technologies such as Lambda, ECS, and EKS, exploring serverless and 
containerized solutions that drive agility and scalability.

With a commitment to reliability, automation, and security, 
I strive to ensure that every system I manage supports the organization’s goals for resilience, compliance, and innovation.
 My mission as a Cloud Administrator is not only to maintain robust cloud environments but also 
 to contribute to strategic decision-making—aligning infrastructure design with long-term business objectives and digital transformation initiatives.    </p>
